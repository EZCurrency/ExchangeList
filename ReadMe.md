### Sources

##### Crypto (Reliable):

##### Fiat and resources (Unchecked):
 - https://www.countries-ofthe-world.com/world-currencies.html

These are semi-auto generated, formatted and exported to the relevant sources. Once we're established the entire process will be automatic. For fiat the process was painstakingly manual. If you know where an always up-to-date and reliable source for these values can be found please create an issue!

### TODO
- Full-Automate Crypto (currently semi)
